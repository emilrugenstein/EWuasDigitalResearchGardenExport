<br><br>
<br>started by two players standing in opposite side and the other players at the middle of the field
<br>the two outside players throw the ball onto the players in the middle after each other and try to hit them
<br>the players in the middle therefore run each time to the opposite side of the throwing outside player
<br>if someone is hit he or she is out of the game
<br>if only one person remains in the middle, the two outside players will try for 5 more times (they often count down loudly), if the middle person survives this her or she is the winner

<br>Name: Osurruo
<br>Player size: 2-4
<br>Age: 6-15
<br>Sex: Both
<br>Duration: 10-30
<br>Occasion: leisure
<br>Category: mental, dexterity
<br>Traditional: yes
<br>Material needed: stones (1 main stone for each player and 12 additional stones)
<br>Mechanics: pattern building, real time, dexterity
<br><br>
<br>Name explanation: no particular meaning, but the main stone of each player is called "Olmenye" which means father in Maa
<br>History: Old game that is played by Masaai for at least several generations
<br>Usage: It is still very liked among kids and often played in school breaks. It is also liked for leisure occasions as it does not require much movement.
<br>Information retrieval: 

<br><a data-href="Ezekiel Roimen" href="https://emilrugenstein.github.io/EWuasDigitalResearchGardenExport/persons/ezekiel-roimen.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ezekiel Roimen</a> interviewed <a data-href="Senewa Maison" href="https://emilrugenstein.github.io/EWuasDigitalResearchGardenExport/persons/senewa-maison.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Senewa Maison</a> on the <a data-href="10-11-2024" href="https://emilrugenstein.github.io/EWuasDigitalResearchGardenExport/10-11-2024" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">10-11-2024</a> 


<br><br>
<br>Each player has one main stone called "Olmenye" (father in Maa) this has to be thrown and catched as the player removes or returns the other 12 stones (called cows) into a hole
<br>The players rotate usually clockwise. One player starts and the others watch if he or she plays right. What matters is that the playing player returns the stones in the right manner.
<br>At the start the main stone is thrown in the air and all other 12 stones have to be removed out of the hole before the Olmenye is catched again.
<br>Afterwards 1 stone has to be returned for each time the Olmenye is thrown into the air. Only the same hand can be used for all this!
<br>Then all stones are removed again (with the same hand during another throw of the Olmenye) and the player has to return 2 each at once until finishing all 12.
<br>This is then continued with returning 3 each, then 4 each, until all 12 are returned at once. If a round number is not dividing 12 evenly the remaining stones will just be put in at once afterwards. Meaning that in round 5 the player has to return 5 stones each and then return the remaining 2 stones afterwards at once. The same for e.g. round 7, first he or she has to return 7 stones and then the remaining 5 stones at once.
<br>The player wins, who manages in his or her turn to do the correct return pattern up to round 12 and does not lose the Olmenye in between.
<br>The winner can then optionally select one of the remaining players and say "Ai shoo enkerai" (I gave you a child) and that selected player can then start trying again. The rotation continues without the winner.

<br>Traditional: no
<br>Material needed: each player needs 1 small and round fruit or ball

<br><br>
<br>Name explanation: Olbanto is Maa and means "something small and round". In English or Swahili the game is called banto (with a soft t)
<br>History: It is more modern and small yellow and round fruits are used (called "Intulele" in Maa and "solanum incanum" as botanical name) or kids in town can buy small and round balls which are sold in shops and called bands or bantos.

<br><br>
<br>Players start at a line which is around 2 meters away from hole. 
<br>The goal is to get the balls into that hole. For that the players start after each other to throw/roll the ball towards the hole.
<br>If nobody manages to get into the hole the players start where their ball stopped last time in the order based on how close they were to the hole (the closest one can go first)
<br>The winner is the one who reaches into the hole first. 
<br>Often this game is repeated many rounds and the wins of each player are counted.

<br>Players sit down in one line with stretched legs forward.
<br>One main player sings the game song and taps each foot after each other with every syllable.
<br>When the song is over the last foot he touched has to be removed (bend).

<br>History: Traditionally the Maasai would practice a lot with arrow and bow and use it to shoot wild animals or to fight other sections or tribes. Today however, it is of less relevance due to the wild life protection regulations and the fact that tensions are usually managed to be settled by negotiations (often with government help).
<br>Usage: It is still practiced today, but significantly less, and only far away from the settlements like Mile 46. Sometimes young boys also build their own bows and try to practice by themselves.

 <br><br>
<br>Name: Enkeshi
<br>Player size: 2-6
<br>Age: 30+
<br>Sex: male
<br>Duration: 30-90
<br>Occasion: mental competition
<br>Category: board game
<br>Traditional: yes
<br>Material needed: 1 Enkeshi board (with 2 times 8 holes) and 48 stones
<br>Mechanics: pick-up and deliver, deck/bag building, area control, grid/area movement, pattern building
<br><br>
<br>Name explanation: "Enkeshi (pl. Inkeshi)" comes from the Maa word "Enkesha" which means to compete. The stones are called "Inkishu" (meaning cows), possibly the name could also come from that. 
<br>History: 

<br>This is a very traditional game, which is for men only, but the story goes that a widowed woman introduced this game first to the Maasai men. It is said that the widow still had many cows, but no one to assist her with the cow deliveries of new calves. Because of that she taught this game to men so that they stay at her home. When the cows gave birth she could ask the playing men who were around to assist.
<br>Traditionally this game is only for Maasai men after they underwent their last big ceremony, the "Olngesher". In this ceremony the left and right hand groups are joined together. The left hand group is a bit younger and has to "catch up" to the right hand group. See more here:  <a data-href="Description#Maasai age groups" href="https://emilrugenstein.github.io/EWuasDigitalResearchGardenExport/description.html#Maasai_age_groups" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Description &gt; Maasai age groups</a> While it was thus only allowed for the 5th and last age group to play the game, younger men would sometimes still build and play it in the sand while herding cattle.
<br>The board is traditionally made from a special tree called Olng'osua by proper carving men.


<br>Usage: Nowadays it is played less and less and only some people still know how to play it. But it used to be very famous before. The game has two sides with 1:1 as a default, but it is often played in teams as well (e.g. 2:2 or 3:3).
<br>Information retrieval: 

<br><a data-href="Ezekiel Roimen" href="https://emilrugenstein.github.io/EWuasDigitalResearchGardenExport/persons/ezekiel-roimen.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ezekiel Roimen</a> interviewed <a data-href="Lapiyioi ole Mampurre" href="https://emilrugenstein.github.io/EWuasDigitalResearchGardenExport/persons/lapiyioi-ole-mampurre.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lapiyioi ole Mampurre</a> on the <a data-href="13-11-2024" href="https://emilrugenstein.github.io/EWuasDigitalResearchGardenExport/13-11-2024" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">13-11-2024</a> 


<br><br>
<br>The board has 8 holes on each sided and the game is played in two opposing teams.
<br>For the beginning each side puts 4 stones in each of the 6 holes on the right hand and the two left holes are left empty.
<br>One side starts by grabbing all the 4 stones from one hole on their side and continues anti-clockwise by putting the stones from the hand back into the wholes one each until the last stone is from the hand is put
<br>If in that hole there are other stones, all stones from that hole are grapped and the previous step is repeated.
<br>This is continued until a hole with no stones is reached with a last stone from the hand. 
<br>The first round of this is especially important as the first end points determine the bank of each side. These two stones in the holes were only one stone remains are called "Olker" (meaning male sheep) and they become the bank of the corresponding side. The bank is called "Emoti" (meaning pot).
<br>Afterwards the players continue in the same manner but now they can start from any hole - expect the bank hole of the other side
<br>The game ends when no movements can be done anymore. This happens when no other hole, besides the two bank holes, has enough stones to reach the next hole.
<br>Now, the stones in the two banks are counted and the side with the most stones wins.
<br>The rules of this game may seem simple, but the dynamics and strategies can quickly become sophisticated.

<br>Name: Enkukuo
<br>Player size: 4+
<br>Age: 7-14
<br>Sex: both
<br>Duration: 5-15
<br>Occasion: leisure
<br>Category: mental
<br>Traditional: yes
<br>Material needed: a small piece of charcoal 
<br>Mechanics: acting, scenario driven
<br><br>
<br>Name explanation: "Enkukuo" is a Maa word and means charcoal, but can also mean voting
<br>History: This game is very traditional and also has a lot engrained Maasai culture in it. For example, the seven stages through which the teams have to go through are also descriptive of what is important in Maasai culture. They are meant to remind people of good development - from a bad state of dirty water to entering a good house with a good environment. See the instructions for the seven stages. 
<br>Usage: It is usually played at night at around 9 p.m. until midnight. There is a believe that when played during the day, livestock will be lost. The game can also be used to teach children about the importance of caring about the environment as the seven stages characterise a positive development

<br><br>
<br>The game is played in two teams, which usually give themselves a name of a Maasai clan (one Maasai section has usually many clans) or of one of the five Maasai age group or any other name
<br>The game will be started by the group who prepared the charcoal, as usually the coal has to be fresh from a burning fire place and cooled down by water or saliva
<br>One person from that team will start by pretending to place the small charcoal on the palms of his teammates, who close their hands to fists right after. 
<br>After this, the other team has to nominate one person, who has to guess the person who has the charcoal. Even the person who was pretending to give the charcoal still could have it in one of his or her fists. 
<br>Normally, it is enough to guess the right person, but sometimes when only few players play this game the correct hand has to be guessed as well. 
<br>The tension of this game often makes smaller kids laugh and this can be used as indication, who has the charcoal.
<br>If the location of the charcoal was guessed correctly it is the other's team turn and that team gets one point. If not the same team starts again with "distributing" the charcoal amongst them and they get a point.
<br>The game is played until one team gets seven points. The seventh point is usually referred to as "entering the house"
<br>The 7 point stages of the game are called: 

<br>"Enkare neingole ilasho" (the water that is spoiled calves) 
<br>"Enkare nasila" (the clean water)
<br>"Nasheta ematua nabo" (the building with one side)
<br>"Nasheta imatuan arre" (the building with two sides) 
<br>"Nasheta imatuan uni" (the building with thre sides) 
<br>"Emparnat olerai" (the complete permanent house) 
<br>"Aajing aji" (entering the house) -&gt; this is the winning stage

<br>Duration: 30-60
<br>Occasion: exercise
<br>Category: throwing, dexterity
<br>Traditional: yes
<br>Material needed: 1 stick per player 
<br>Mechanics: dexterity, scenario driven
<br><br>
<br>Name explanation: "Olenkiserpep" is a Maa word and describes the sound and action of the sliding sticks.
<br>History: 

<br>This game is very traditionally and used as a way of approaching girls, by competing for them and teasing them if one has "won" a particular girl. Traditionally only girls from other clans can be considered for a marriage, but this is ignored for this game as it is only playing with potential relationships. Still, after the game the players often approach the ladies who they won and sometimes relationships start from it.
<br>The sticks to play with are traditionally from a shrub called "Ositeti" (Grewia Bicolor) and have to be very straight. Each young man should have his own stick.


<br>Usage: It is still very much played nowadays by young boys in the same manner.

<br><br>
<br>The game should take place on a straight road or field and can be started by any player from the starting line which is previously drawn into the sand.
<br>The players will slide their stick in a straight manner forward, with the goal to slide as far as possible. The stick has to touch the ground at the starting line, otherwise the throw does not count.
<br>For each round the players decide for a name of a girl of similar or younger age which they now. The round is then about this girl.
<br>The player who slided the furthest wins the round and thereby also the girl.
<br>This repeated until the players decided to end it or until one player reaches a previously agreed number of girls.
<br>The player who "won" the most girls, wins.

<br>The first player starts to kick the ball into the air and then bumps the ball repeatedly with the same leg.
<br>Each bounce is counted loudly and the player has to stop when the ball touches the ground.
<br>The number of bounces will then be added to the score of that player and its the next player's turn.
<br>The scores are written and changed into the sand as a table with either numbers or the initials of the players as header and their score below. After each turn the score of that player will be updated accoridingly.

<br>A field of 2 x 5 rectangles is drawn. With the last field on each side being longer than the other ones.
<br>Then one player starts by throwing a stone into the first rectangle on one side.
<br>Now the player has to jump into that tile and kick the stone on one leg only into the next rectangle until he or she reaches the end and then has to come back on the other side. The player has two jump on leg but can rest and put both legs down in the longer rectangles at the end.
<br>During this the stone cannot move further than one rectangle at a time and also the feet of the jumping player are not allowed to touch the lines. If this happens an outside player screams "banned" and the next player can try.
<br>If a player finishes the first round, he or she now has two throw the stone into the second rectangle, jump to that rectangle and then start from there again. 
<br>This is then continued until the 5th rectangle and then backwards on the other side.

<br>Name explanation: Oltingilo is the Maa word for the game and refers to the rounds the player make. In English this game is called rounder.
<br>History: It's a traditional game, that has a traditional song to it that is sung while playing it and originally also involved kids trying to escape from the middle of the circle. However, the game seems to have evolved and it is now played in a simpler version.

 <br>
<br>New game that revolves around how people can act together to protect nature. 
<br>This game is meant as inspiration and can be tweaked and modified in all ways that the players or the game master can think of - towards a certain teaching purpose or just towards more fun.
<br><br>
<br>Name: Maasai Village (preliminary name)
<br>Player size: 4-8
<br>Duration: decided by game master but around 15min
<br>Traditional: no
<br>Material needed: small stones, something to draw (sand or pen &amp; paper), and a coin or other flipping device
<br><br>
<br>Inspired by traditional arrangement of Maasai settlements and their food sharing practices.
<br>Also includes invasive species dynamic with quadratic growth.
<br>In general this game works well if the game master uses story telling (e.g. narrating how the village wakes up or now has to make a decision in the evening, etc.) and the game master can reinvent, extend and bend the rules in that matter, to keep the game dynamic interesting and filled with learning moments
<br><br>
<br>all players start with one stones which symbolize one cows
<br>their is one game master who moderates the game through the different stages, controls for correct coin flipping, draws the invasive species (into sand or on a paper) and controls the end conditions
<br>in every round

<br>

<br>every player who has at least one cow can flip a coin or uproot one plant


<br>when flipping a coin, head means this player gets an additional cow and tails means no new cow is born
<br>when uprooting one plant, the player can delete one 


<br>

<br>then they have to kill at least one cow from a player which has to put the stone voluntarily into the middle (afterwards the cow is then taken by the game master)


<br>here a lot of discussions are expected and in a way this is the heart of the game
<br>at this stage players can also do other arrangement like renting a cow to other players who don't have any cow 


<br>

<br>Afterwards a potential drought or disease kills a cow of every player. For this the game master flips a coin twice and only two times tail means that a stone is taken from every player


<br>

<br>the invasive species grows




<br>growing stages of invasive species

<br>1 stroke, 2 strokes, 3 strokes = 1 plant (grass plant painted with 3 stalks)
<br>afterwards the plants double at every stage


<br>end of game if 

<br>either all players lose the game by

<br>a) the invasive species reaches 16 or more plants
<br>or b)  no cow is killed or can be killed in a round


<br>or the game master decides that the time is over 

<br>the game master has the freedom to decide freely as this will promote more interesting collaboration strategies 

<br>rational game theory but also common sense explain that the players will act very differently if they e.g. know that the game will be over in three rounds. That's why a more realistic situation is created if the game master decides more freely when the game is ended


<br>afterwards the cows of each player are then counted and the one with the most cows wins 

<br>but also the whole community can "win" in a game if they managed to have many cows altogether (compared to another game round)
<br>maybe play around and experiment what winning condition works better (most total cows as whole group or most individual cows from one player)

<br><br>
<br>Name: Maji Safi au Mchanga Chafu
<br>Player size: 3 - 8
<br>Duration: 
<br>Traditional: no
<br>Material needed: sand, plate, cups
<br><br>
<br>Name explanation: Maji Safi au Mchanga Chafu is Swahili and means "clear water or dirty sand"
<br>The dynamic of common pollution (sand stacking up), which requires action that has a certain sacrifice (giving away from one's own water reserve), can be used to explore collective action problems and solutions together
<br><br>
<br>everyone has a cup and gets a bit of water every round from the game master

<br>the game ends and one player wins if he has a full cup (potentially it is possible that all win together in a round)


<br>but there is a metal plate on which the game master puts sand every round (a varying amount)

<br>everyone loses if after the sand is put (always in the centre) the whole area is covered
<br>that's why after the sand is put in every round players have to discuss if some of them use some of the water to clean sand from the plate

 <br><br>This is work-in-progress collection of games that are played by the Maasai community in Elangata Wuas in Kenya. <br><br>This is only a collection of some games. However, the list is based on walking around Elangata Wuas and asking people of different ages, what their favourite games are.<br>

<br>Note: The "mechanics" field of the game descriptions is meant to provoke thoughts about different mechanics that are commonly used in this context with the intention to serve as inspiration for the kind of games that could be designed together with e.g. teachers. The field and its intentions are based on the <a class="internal-link" data-href="gameofgames.net" href="https://emilrugenstein.github.io/EWuasDigitalResearchGardenExport/gameofgames.net" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Game of Games</a> which was designed by <a data-href="Caroline Archambault" href="https://emilrugenstein.github.io/EWuasDigitalResearchGardenExport/persons/caroline-archambault.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Caroline Archambault</a>.<br><br>
<br>With certain clapping patterns:

<br>Police Central: Children in circle and "pass on" a clap by receiving on the right and passing on with the left hand. At the end of a singing song that kid can shoot one of the other kids from the circle. Than this is repeated again without that kid. 

<br>Played at <a data-href="Emirishoi Primary School" href="https://emilrugenstein.github.io/EWuasDigitalResearchGardenExport/schools/emirishoi-primary-school.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Emirishoi Primary School</a> when visited by <a data-href="Ezekiel Roimen" href="https://emilrugenstein.github.io/EWuasDigitalResearchGardenExport/persons/ezekiel-roimen.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ezekiel Roimen</a> and <a data-href="Emil Rugenstein" href="https://emilrugenstein.github.io/EWuasDigitalResearchGardenExport/persons/emil-rugenstein.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Emil Rugenstein</a> on <a data-href="17-07-2025" href="https://emilrugenstein.github.io/EWuasDigitalResearchGardenExport/fieldnotes/17-07-2025.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">17-07-2025</a>.

<br>Sumsum: Another clapping game whereby 4 kids, standing in a rectangle, clap in a certain pattern with both hands. Sometimes across each other, sometimes changing to the left or right partner. The song continues into the ABC and the game is started again when one of the kids misses the correct pattern. 

<br>Played at <a data-href="Emirishoi Primary School" href="https://emilrugenstein.github.io/EWuasDigitalResearchGardenExport/schools/emirishoi-primary-school.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Emirishoi Primary School</a> when visited by <a data-href="Ezekiel Roimen" href="https://emilrugenstein.github.io/EWuasDigitalResearchGardenExport/persons/ezekiel-roimen.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Ezekiel Roimen</a> and <a data-href="Emil Rugenstein" href="https://emilrugenstein.github.io/EWuasDigitalResearchGardenExport/persons/emil-rugenstein.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Emil Rugenstein</a> on <a data-href="17-07-2025" href="https://emilrugenstein.github.io/EWuasDigitalResearchGardenExport/fieldnotes/17-07-2025.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">17-07-2025</a>

<br>Colour jumping game: Kids play outside and draw three or more long fields into the sand in which they line up. Every line has one colour and one kid now screams one colour after another and the other kids have to jump to that line/column. The catch is that the kid can scream non-existing colours . If kids move at a call of a colour that is not included or if they jump to the wrong column they have to step to the side. The game continues till only one kid is left.

<br><br>The goal is to develop new games which make people think about how people can protect nature by acting together. The process itself of designing such games can be a way to spark thoughts and ideas on this topic. Playing and designing these games can also be used to observe how people think and act collectively.<br><br><a data-href="Emil Rugenstein" href="https://emilrugenstein.github.io/EWuasDigitalResearchGardenExport/persons/emil-rugenstein.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Emil Rugenstein</a> designed two games which can serve as an example of the kind of games that can be useful for game-based learning and research about Collective Action and Nature Protection<br>

<br><br>During the research weeks in which theses notes were collected, daily notes were taken on every significant day and occasion. The notes also include links to video material and persons like teachers who were interviewed. <br>
<br>For going through the field notes, please go into the folder "/FieldNotes" 

<br>NOTE: This folder will and should not be published online


<br>The field notes will have references to persons, schools and videos for further information. Each of these categories can also be visited directly in its dedicated folder 

<br>NOTE: These folders also will not be published online
<br>Also note that the files of interviewed persons have the written interview notes as well as the audio file


<br><br><br>There are five traditional stages in the life of a Maasai<br>
<br>Young ones 

<br>Enkipaata -&gt; circumcision as transition to next group (newly circumcised)

<br>traditionally with around 20 years, but nowadays often done earlier




<br>Newly circumcised

<br>Shaving ceremony as transition to next group

<br>nowadays boys can decide if the go back to school afterwards or the become a real Morang




<br>Warriors (Morran)

<br>Climax of Maasai live
<br>The often grow their hair very long
<br>Another very big ceremony (called "Eunoto") which ends the Morran-Ship


<br>Young elders 

<br>Last ceremony is the "Olngesher" where the younger left hand group and the right hand group are joined together as one cohort


<br>Elders

 <br>
<br>Topic: How to act together to protect nature?
<br>Method: Develop, brainstorm or/and play games which revolve around that question.

<br><a data-href="Caroline Archambault" href="https://emilrugenstein.github.io/EWuasDigitalResearchGardenExport/persons/caroline-archambault.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Caroline Archambault</a> proposed a plan A, B, and C strategy

<br>plan A: "develop games together"

<br>inspired by the Game of Games approach, form small groups which have to creatively develop their own games around the given topic and with possibly some given constraints on "mandatory" game mechanics, game utensils, and setting


<br>plan B: "hacking games they already know"

<br>take games they already now and think about how you could convert them into something where people learn about X


<br>plan C: "what do you think about these ideas and games?"

<br>ask them what they already know about biodiversity loss /collective action and try game which we developed before






<br><br><br>
<br>Introduce myself and ask some general questions about the class to warm up
<br>Split class into groups of around 4 and hand out paper

<br>possibly consult a teacher for good group splits


<br><br>
<br>Give the groups time to write down answers on the following questions
<br>On Collective Action:

<br>Where do people act together?
<br>How can people act together?
<br>When do people fail to act together?


<br>On Nature Protection

<br>Why is a healthy nature important to humans? (Potentially only verbally together to save time)
<br>What problems does our nature have right now? (Potentially only verbally as well) 
<br>How can we protect nature?


<br><br>
<br>Collect some answers, but this should not be exhaustive 

<br>good way to do this is in a lightning format -&gt; every group says after each other one answer that has not been said before


<br><br>
<br>Collect games they know and like and make them think about them
<br>Ask to answer the following questions:

<br>What games do you like? Why?

<br>But ask them to go beyond big ball sports i.e. football, volleyball, netball and handball


<br>What do players learn in these games?


<br><br>
<br>Again collect some answers
<br>Now, ask them to design a game in which the players learn something about how we can protect nature by acting together by either

<br>a) coming up with new games 
<br>or b) modifying the collected games 


<br>Provide some inspiration by 

<br>providing list with materials, which they can but don't have to use:

<br>small stones
<br>sand
<br>timer/clock
<br>cups
<br>dice
<br>ball
<br>pen and paper
<br>string
<br>anything else they can think of


<br>prompting them that students like them should like to play it
<br>reminding them to think back to the answers of the previous two sections


<br><br>
<br>Go around and help brainstorming
<br>It's ok and expectable that they will be probably be a bit confused for the first 5 - 10 mins
<br>But if all goes good, then here the magic happens

<br>If not jump to Option C


<br><br>
<br>Explain game and play it first with one group while others are watching (10min)

<br><a data-href="NG1 Maasai Village" href="https://emilrugenstein.github.io/EWuasDigitalResearchGardenExport/games/ng1-maasai-village.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">NG1 Maasai Village</a>


<br>Then let them play together in groups (10-15min)

<br>possibly merge groups so the groups are better oversee-able 
<br>encourage them to play multiple times


<br><br>
<br>Option A&amp;B: 

<br>Share different games and let the groups explain it
<br>Encourage a concise explanation as this otherwise can easily crash the time frame


<br>Option C: 

<br>Ask them to reflect on the game play and what different strategies where used and to which results they led
